                <h3>Potato leaf disease detection</h3>
                <p>The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the identification and
                     diagnosis of diseases affecting potato leaves. By leveraging CNNs, the system can analyze
                      images of potato leaves and accurately classify them based on the presence or absence of diseases
                       such as blight, late blight, or early blight. This automated approach streamlines the disease
                        detection process, enabling farmers and agricultural professionals to quickly identify diseased
                         plants and take timely preventive measures. .</p>

                <h3>Extractive text summarization</h3>
                <p>The project focused on implementing and comparing two extractive text summarization algorithms: 
                    TextRank and Frequency-Based summarization. Both algorithms achieved perfect recall, 
                    indicating their ability to capture all relevant information. However, 
                    the Frequency-Based method outperformed TextRank in terms of precision and F1 Score, 
                    suggesting better sentence selection for the summary. The choice between the two algorithms
                     depends on specific project requirements and the desired balance between precision and recall.
